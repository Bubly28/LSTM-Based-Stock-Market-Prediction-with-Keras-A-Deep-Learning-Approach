# LSTM-Based-Stock-Market-Prediction-with-Keras-A-Deep-Learning-Approach
This project aims to explore stock market prediction and financial analysis using Keras, focusing on the application of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models. The objective is to understand the dynamics of stock data, including seasonality, volatility, and non-stationarity, and to critically evaluate the effectiveness of deep learning methods for stock prediction. 

Findings:
The project demonstrates the capability of LSTM models to capture complex patterns in time-series stock data, resulting in accurate predictions of future stock prices. Through thorough evaluation, the LSTM model achieved low Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), indicating high predictive power and reliability in stock market analysis. 

Process:
1. Data Collection: Real-world stock data from NVIDIA was collected using Yahoo Finance's API.
2. Data Preprocessing: Various preprocessing techniques were applied, including index resetting, resampling to business days, and handling missing values.
3. Model Development: LSTM models were implemented using Keras and TensorFlow, with multiple layers to capture intricate patterns in the data.
4. Model Training: The LSTM models were trained using historical stock data to learn patterns and trends.
5. Evaluation: The trained models were evaluated using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) to assess their predictive performance.
6. Analysis: The project analyzed the model's predictions and provided insights into stock market trends and future predictions.

Through this project, we gained valuable insights into the application of deep learning techniques for stock market analysis, highlighting the potential for LSTM models to enhance financial decision-making processes.
